# Python 3D Graphics Engine

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)


3D graphics engine built entirely in python! Pygame is currently the only library being used only for UI and drawing pixels, since pygame only supports 2D alot of math is involved in projection. Maybe one day
i'll get to writing a easier simple python pixel engine :)

This project is heavily influenced by javidx9's code for a custom graphics engine in C++! Check out his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA)


### Installation

Python 3D Graphics Engine requires Pygame to run.

Install the dependencies (ideally in a virtual environment)

```sh
$ pip install pygame
```
## Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
```
